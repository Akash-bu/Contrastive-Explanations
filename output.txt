Block 1  
ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem is accepted because it already carries its own index value, ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX. That little numeric tag shows exactly where the header sits in a larger series, so the system recognises it as the right kind of header-with-index.  

AveragedAtlasHeader_Skolem is rejected because no index value is linked to it. Without that pointer, the system cannot tell which position it belongs to, so it stays outside the group.  

If AveragedAtlasHeader_Skolem were given a clear index value of its own and linked to it in the same way, it would be treated just like ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem.  


Block 2  
AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX fits the category because it is explicitly marked as an integer number. Being tagged “Int” tells the system it is a simple count or position.  

DimensionVal_Skolem_Dim is left out because it is not marked as an integer at all, so the system does not see it as a numeric index.  

Mark DimensionVal_Skolem_Dim as an integer value, and it would be welcomed into the same group.  


Block 3  
WarpParams_Skolem_IDX qualifies since it is labelled as an integer. That numeric status lets it serve as a clean index for warp-parameter information.  

DimensionVal_Skolem_Dim lacks this numeric label, so the system does not treat it as an index.  

Give DimensionVal_Skolem_Dim the “Int” label and it would be treated just like WarpParams_Skolem_IDX.  


Block 4  
AtlasY_Skolem_Dim is accepted because it is identified as a text string, signalling that it stores descriptive text rather than numbers.  

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX is not recognised here because it is not tagged as a string.  

Label AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX as a string, and it would meet the same requirement.  


Block 5  
namePrefix falls into the set because it is classified as a string. That tells the system it is plain text suitable for naming things.  

ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX does not belong because it is not marked as text; instead, it is an integer value.  

If ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX were tagged as a string instead of an integer, it would be treated like namePrefix.  


Block 6  
DimensionVal_Skolem is recognised because it is tagged as a “DimensionValFile,” meaning it stores dimension-specific values.  

ReferenceHeaderFile_Skolem lacks that file-type tag, so the system keeps it out of this category.  

Add the “DimensionValFile” label to ReferenceHeaderFile_Skolem and it would qualify in the same way.  


Block 7  
WarpParams_Skolem_IDX is included because it is declared to be an integer value.  

AtlasXSlice_Skolem_Dim is excluded since it is not marked as an integer; it is seen as descriptive text instead.  

Mark AtlasXSlice_Skolem_Dim as an integer, and it would stand beside WarpParams_Skolem_IDX.  


Block 8  
ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX is accepted thanks to its “Int” label, showing it is a numeric index.  

namePrefix is ignored here because it is a string, not an integer.  

If namePrefix were re-labelled as an integer, it would satisfy the same rule.  


Block 9  
ReferenceImageFile_Skolem is counted because it carries the special type “ReferenceImageFile,” signalling that it holds baseline image data for alignment.  

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem does not bear that type, so it remains outside the set.  

Give AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem the “ReferenceImageFile” designation, and it would be accepted in the same way.  


Block 10  
AtlasZSlice_Skolem_Dim fits because it is identified as a string, indicating textual slice information.  

AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX is not tagged as a string, so it is left out.  

Tag AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX as a string and it would meet the same requirement.  


Block 11  
AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem is accepted thanks to its explicit type “AnatomyHeaderFile,” marking it as a header that describes anatomical images.  

DimensionVal_Skolem lacks this specialised type and therefore does not join the group.  

Assign the “AnatomyHeaderFile” type to DimensionVal_Skolem and it would qualify just the same.  


Block 12  
AtlasSlice_Skolem is included because it is flagged as an “AtlasSlice,” showing that it represents an individual slice from an atlas.  

WarpParams_Skolem is not recognised here because it carries no such slice designation.  

Label WarpParams_Skolem as an “AtlasSlice,” and it would be treated like AtlasSlice_Skolem.  


Block 13  
(The same reasoning applies as in Block 12 because the information is repeated.)  


Block 14  
ReslicedImageFile_Skolem is accepted because it bears the specialised type “ReslicedImageFile,” indicating an image that has been resampled to match another grid.  

WarpParams_Skolem does not have this image-file type, so it is excluded.  

If WarpParams_Skolem were tagged as a “ReslicedImageFile,” it would be handled the same way.  


Block 15  
AtlasXSlice_Skolem_Dim is allowed because it is marked as a string.  

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX is not, so it fails to qualify.  

Mark AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX as a string, and it would be accepted.  


Block 16  
DimensionX_Skolem_Dim is inside the set by virtue of being a string.  

ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX is outside because it is an integer instead.  

If ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX were labelled as a string, it would join DimensionX_Skolem_Dim.  


Block 17  
DimensionVal_Skolem is chosen because it is a “DimensionValFile” and it is linked to DimensionVal_Skolem_Dim through a has-dimension link.  

ReferenceHeaderFile_Skolem lacks both the special file type and that dimension link, so it is left out.  

Give ReferenceHeaderFile_Skolem the same “DimensionValFile” label and connect it to an appropriate dimension, and it would be treated the same.  


Block 18  
AtlasSlice_Skolem qualifies because it is connected to AtlasSlice_Skolem_Dim via a dimension link.  

AveragedAtlasImage_Skolem has no such connection, so it does not qualify.  

Create a similar dimension link for AveragedAtlasImage_Skolem, and it would be viewed like AtlasSlice_Skolem.  


Block 19  
(Identical reasoning to Block 15: AtlasXSlice_Skolem_Dim is a string; AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX is not.)  


Block 20  
DimensionZ_Skolem_Dim is accepted as it is classified as a string.  

WarpParams_Skolem_IDX lacks that string label and is therefore excluded.  

Label WarpParams_Skolem_IDX as a string and it would qualify.  


Block 21  
ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX makes the cut because it is an integer.  

AtlasSlice_Skolem_Dim does not, since it is not marked as an integer.  

Mark AtlasSlice_Skolem_Dim as an integer, and it would be let in.  


Block 22  
ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX is included owing to its integer status.  

AtlasY_Skolem_Dim is excluded because it is not an integer.  

Give AtlasY_Skolem_Dim an integer label, and it would join the same set.  


Block 23  
DimensionX_Skolem_Dim qualifies as it is a string.  

ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX is not tagged as a string, so it is omitted.  

Tag ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX as a string, and it would be accepted.  


Block 24  
GraphicalAtlasImage_Skolem is accepted because it is tied to GraphicalAtlasImage_Skolem_Dim through a has-dimension link.  

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem lacks such a link, so the system does not see it as having that dimension.  

Add an equivalent dimension link to AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem and it would qualify likewise.  


Block 25  
DimensionZ_Skolem_Dim is in because it is labelled as a string.  

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX, lacking that label, is left out.  

Label AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX as a string and it would fit the rule.  


Block 26  
ReferenceHeaderFile_Skolem belongs because it is tagged as a “ReferenceHeaderFile,” indicating a header that provides reference orientation.  

AveragedAtlasHeader_Skolem has no such tag, so it is excluded.  

Attach the “ReferenceHeaderFile” label to AveragedAtlasHeader_Skolem, and it would be treated the same.  


Block 27  
ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX is accepted for being an integer.  

AtlasX_Skolem_Dim is not accepted because it is viewed as a string, not an integer.  

If AtlasX_Skolem_Dim were labelled as an integer, it would qualify.  


Block 28  
AveragedAtlasHeader_Skolem fits since it carries the “AveragedAtlasHeader” tag, marking it as the combined header for averaged atlas data.  

AnatomyImageFile_Skolem lacks that tag and so is excluded.  

Tag AnatomyImageFile_Skolem as an “AveragedAtlasHeader,” and it would be included.  


Block 29  
AtlasSlice_Skolem_Dim is in because it is a string.  

AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX is out because it is not labelled as a string.  

Apply the string label to AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX, and it would belong.  


Block 30  
ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX counts because it is an integer.  

AtlasZ_Skolem_Dim does not count because it is not an integer.  

Label AtlasZ_Skolem_Dim as an integer, and it would qualify.  


Block 31  
AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX is included since it is marked as an integer.  

AtlasYSlice_Skolem_Dim is excluded for lacking that integer mark.  

Give AtlasYSlice_Skolem_Dim the integer label, and it would fit.  


Block 32  
AtlasX_Skolem_Dim is accepted because it is noted as a string.  

AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX is not accepted since it is not labelled as a string.  

Mark AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX as a string to include it.  


Block 33  
DimensionVal_Skolem_Dim is in by virtue of being a string.  

ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX is out for not being a string.  

Label ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX as a string and it would qualify.  


Block 34  
DimensionX_Skolem_Dim is allowed because it is a string.  

ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX is not, lacking that string label.  

Tag ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX as a string, and it would be treated the same.  


Block 35  
ReslicedHeaderFile_Skolem is accepted thanks to its “ReslicedHeaderFile” type, marking it as a header produced by reslicing.  

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem does not have this resliced-header tag, so it remains outside.  

Give AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem the “ReslicedHeaderFile” designation, and it would be included.  


Block 36  
AtlasYSlice_Skolem_Dim fits because it is labelled as a string.  

WarpParams_Skolem_IDX does not fit, as it lacks that label.  

Label WarpParams_Skolem_IDX as a string and it would qualify.  


Block 37  
AtlasYSlice_Skolem_Dim is accepted for being a string.  

AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX is not accepted because it is not marked as a string.  

Mark AnatomyImageFile_Skolem_IDX as a string, and it would be included.  


Block 38  
AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem is included because it bears the “AnatomyHeaderFile” type.  

AveragedAtlasImage_Skolem lacks that type, so it is excluded.  

Add the “AnatomyHeaderFile” tag to AveragedAtlasImage_Skolem and it would qualify.  


Block 39  
ReslicedImageFile_Skolem is accepted because it is linked to its own index value ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX.  

AveragedAtlasHeader_Skolem lacks any index link, so it does not join the group.  

Attach an index value to AveragedAtlasHeader_Skolem, and it would be handled like ReslicedImageFile_Skolem.  


Block 40  
ReslicedImageFile_Skolem_IDX counts because it is an integer.  

DimensionY_Skolem_Dim is left out because it is not labelled as an integer.  

Label DimensionY_Skolem_Dim as an integer and it would qualify.  


Block 41  
GraphicalAtlasImage_Skolem_Dim is accepted for being a string value.  

WarpParams_Skolem_IDX is not, since it is not marked as a string.  

If WarpParams_Skolem_IDX were tagged as a string, it would fit the same rule.  


Block 42  
WarpParams_Skolem is included because it is a “WarpParamsFile” and it carries an index value WarpParams_Skolem_IDX.  

AveragedAtlasImage_Skolem holds neither the special file tag nor an index, so it is excluded.  

Give AveragedAtlasImage_Skolem the “WarpParamsFile” label and attach an index value, and it would qualify just the same.  


Block 43  
AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX is in for being an integer.  

AtlasYSlice_Skolem_Dim is out for lacking that integer status.  

Tag AtlasYSlice_Skolem_Dim as an integer, and it would be accepted.  


Block 44  
GraphicalAtlasImage_Skolem is accepted because it is labelled “GraphicalAtlasImage” and is linked to a dimension value.  

ReferenceImageFile_Skolem has neither the special image label nor the dimension link, so it stays out.  

Give ReferenceImageFile_Skolem the same label and link it to a dimension, and it would be treated like GraphicalAtlasImage_Skolem.  


Block 45  
AtlasSlice_Skolem_Dim is accepted since it is recognised as a string.  

WarpParams_Skolem_IDX is not because it is not labelled as a string.  

Label WarpParams_Skolem_IDX as a string, and it would fit.  


Block 46  
AtlasYSlice_Skolem_Dim is in due to its string label.  

WarpParams_Skolem_IDX is out for lacking that label.  

Add the string label to WarpParams_Skolem_IDX and it would qualify.

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX qualifies because it is an integer.  

GraphicalAtlasImage_Skolem_Dim does not qualify since it is not labelled as an integer.  

Label GraphicalAtlasImage_Skolem_Dim as an integer and it would be accepted.  


Block 48  
DimensionVal_Skolem makes the cut because it is linked to DimensionVal_Skolem_Dim through a dimension connection.  

ReslicedImageFile_Skolem lacks such a link, so it does not qualify.  

Provide ReslicedImageFile_Skolem with a similar dimension link and it would be treated the same.  


Block 49  
GraphicalAtlasImage_Skolem is accepted because it carries the “GraphicalAtlasImage” type.  

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem does not have that type, so it is excluded.  

Assign the “GraphicalAtlasImage” label to AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem, and it would qualify.  


Block 50  
DimensionVal_Skolem is included thanks to its “DimensionValFile” tag.  

WarpParams_Skolem lacks that designation, so it is left out.  

Apply the “DimensionValFile” tag to WarpParams_Skolem and it would be accepted.  


Block 51  
namePrefix is accepted as it is tagged as a string.  

AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX is not accepted because it is not a string.  

Label AnatomyHeaderFile_Skolem_IDX as a string, and it would join namePrefix.  


Block 52  
DimensionX_Skolem_Dim is accepted for being a string.  

WarpParams_Skolem_IDX is rejected for lacking that label.  

Mark WarpParams_Skolem_IDX as a string, and it would qualify.
